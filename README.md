# Boston Gies – Portfolio Website

A lightweight portfolio website built for composer **Boston Gies** using simple, semantic HTML and CSS.

This project originally started as a birthday gift — just a picture of Boston with a 'Happy Birthday' message. Over time, this will continue to be fleshed out into an intentional portfolio meant to act as a long-term showcase for his compositions, style, and musical identity.


## Purpose

- Provide a centralized place to showcase Boston’s composition work  
- Keep the site lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain  
- Avoid visual clutter or trendy UI patterns that distract from the content  
- Make it simple to update as new pieces are written
