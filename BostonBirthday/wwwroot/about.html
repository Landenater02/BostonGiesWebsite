                <h1>Fun Bio</h1>
                <p>
                    I’m Boston Geo – producer, trumpet player, and professional over-thinker
                    of chord progressions. I grew up obsessed with movie soundtracks and
                    video-game music, which slowly mutated into a love for jazz harmony and
                    electronic production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my tracks start as ideas on a beat-up keyboard or a trumpet
                    line I can’t get out of my head. From there I build layers of drums,
                    synths, and textures until it feels like its own little world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not writing or recording, I’m probably at a show, hanging out
                    in a practice room, or mixing for friends. I like collaborators who are
                    curious, a little weird, and not afraid to try something that might fail
                    spectacularly.
