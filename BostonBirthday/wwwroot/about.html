                <h1>Bio</h1>
                <p>
                    Boston Gies is a composer, vocalist, and electronic musician. 
                    He is interested in working on film, TV, and video game music. 
                    Boston loves sculpting worlds with music, whether with electronic
                    or acoustic instrumentation. He is currently composing a comedic,
                    absurd cowboy-western musical titled “The Golden Mule.”

                    It will be premiering on April 12th, 2026. In 2022, he released his
                    “SKELETONS IN A CAVE”, a colorful, trip-hop-inspired concept album
                    establishing his ability to create imaginative works. He also works
                    as a producer and collaborative artist with other musicians.

                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    He expects to graduate with a degree in Music Business and Audio
                    Production and with a certificate in composition at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh.
